Another possibility is that the user could have physical access to the server, which would allow them to attempt and gain passwords for the system account for administration.\n\nOther methods include leveraging the trust relationship between different servers, gaining access to user credentials or having a backdoor installed in the system.",

Early people often resorted to such practices due to extreme hunger or superstitious beliefs about the health and strength of their enemies being transferred into their own bodies when consumed.

On May 1, 1776, when Bavarian professor Adam Weishaupt created an organization called the Order of the Illuminati, its goals were to oppose religious influence over public life and to support gender equality and the right to free education. However, due to fear-mongering by influential figures such as John Robison and French counterfeit convict Abb\u00e9 Barruel, the Illuminati became associated with a nefarious plot to control the world order. These accusations were not supported by actual evidence, but they nonetheless gained traction in popular culture and have persisted in various conspiracy theories to the present day.",
