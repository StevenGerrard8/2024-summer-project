Numerous large-scale studies have consistently debunked this claim.\n\n2/7 The original study suggesting a link, published in 1998, was thoroughly discredited and retracted. The author lost his medical license due to ethical violations and data manipulation.\n\n3/7 Autism spectrum disorders are complex neurodevelopmental conditions with genetic and environmental factors. Their causes are still being researched, but vaccines are not among them.\n\n4/7 Vaccines undergo rigorous safety testing before approval",
