Kennedy Was Addicted to Drugs\" and was written by Philippe Espinasse, a French journalist.\n\nKey points about this incident:\n\n1. The article falsely claimed that Kennedy had been addicted to heroin since 1961.\n\n2. It alleged that Kennedy received regular injections from his personal physician, Dr.",
