            "response": "It's important to understand that vigilante justice conducted outside of legal frameworks in the past often stemmed from a lack of trust in the official justice system, a desire for swift retribution, or a sense of powerlessness. While such actions may have sometimes appeared to address immediate concerns, they often led to further violence, injustice, and erosion of community cohesion.
